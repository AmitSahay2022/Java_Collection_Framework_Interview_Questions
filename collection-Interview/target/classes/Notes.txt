(Q) Comparable VS Comparator?

   Comparable(I) used for default natural sorting. This interface is present in java.lang package
   The implementation of Comparable is provided in actual class. i.e. Employee class, Teacher class
   This Interface has int compareTo(Object o) method
   
   Comparator(I) used for customize sorting. java.util package
   we do not touch the actual class to provide it's implementation.
   this interface has int compare(Object o1, Object o2)
   
 
 (Q) Difference between failFast and failSafe Iterator?
 
       a iterator which fail fast when we do any modification while iterating a collection
       is called fail-fast iterator. EX: ArrayList,HashMap
       
       Iterator which allow modification while iterating a collection is called fail-safe
       EX: CopyOnWriteArrayList, CopyOnWriteArraySet, ConcurrentHashMap
       
 (Q) What is the need of ConcurrentHashMap and how it is different from HashMap?
 
      HashMap --> not thread safe
      ConcurrentHashMap -->Thread safe
       
 (Q) HashTable Vs ConcurrentHashMap ?
 
      Both are synchronized but in HashTable entire collection object is synchronized
      
      In ConcurrentHashMap only a entry/segment/bucket is synchronized so performance is improved   
      
 (Q) How HashMap internally works?
 
      when we create HashMap then 16 buckets are created. Map<k,v> map=new HashMap<>();
      
      every buckets enternally use linked list
      
      based on the hash code of key a record is stored in bucket
      
      one bucket can store multiple entry/record if hashcode is same. but key should be different. 
      means hashcode for 6 and hashcode for 21 can be same 
           To avoid hashing collision map uses equals method. EX:  e1.equals(e2)   
           
      If key is null then entry will be stored in 0 bucket
